        </p>
        <p class="mat-body-1" i18n="faq page panel seven answer two">
          Wingspan does not have the capabilities to record videos or author PDF or HTML Content directly
          on its authoring tool.<br />
          If you have created Videos either using screen-capture using tools like Captivate,
          Camtasia or converting PPTs to Videos with voiceover or even using a video recording
          device like Phones, Video Cameras, Wingspan allows you to create courses out of such
          content.<br />
          Course creation involves providing a good amount of meta-data for non-text based contents
          such as Videos.
